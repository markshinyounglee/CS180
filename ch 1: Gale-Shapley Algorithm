Starting with n men and n women:
1. Every night, n men visit their favorite woman's balcony and serenades.
2. If the woman has not been engaged yet, she gets engaged with her first favorite.
3. The rejected men crosses their top pick off their list and visits their next favorite the next evening
4. If she likes the suitor better, she breaks the engagement and sets her former fiance free
5. Men continues to visit women according to their descending order of preference until everybody is matched

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Characteristics:
- Men are freed and engaged; women are always engaged once a man visits
- Men goes down the list of preferences; women goes up the list of preferences
- When there is at least one free man, then he did not propose to all women
- There can be at most n^2 total proposals since a man does not propose twice to the same woman
- The algorithm is men-optimal and women-pessimal; that is, the result matches men with their best valid spouse and women with worst valid spouse

Problem-Solving Strategy:
- Identify core assumptions of Gale-Shapley Algorithm
- Prove ~: Try to use proof of contradiction
- Examine the implications of assumption and try to find the logical flaw that follows it
